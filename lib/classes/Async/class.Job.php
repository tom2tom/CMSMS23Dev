 * @property-read int $created The unix timestamp that this job was first created.
 * @property string $module The module that created this job.  Useful if the job ever needs to be deleted.
 * @property int $start The minimum time that this job should start at.
 * @property-read int $errors The number of errors encountered while trying to pricess this job.
