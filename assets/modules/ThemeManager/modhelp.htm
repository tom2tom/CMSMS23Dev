<h3>What Does This Do?</h3>
<p>This module helps you to export, import and manage <strong>theme packages</strong>, which can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>smarty templates</li>
<li>stylesheets</li>
<li>stylesheet groups</li>
<li>tags
<ul>
<li>regular CMSMS smarty-plugins</li>
<li>user-plugins (a.k.a. user-defined tags)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>media files (images, movies, sounds)</li>
<li>custom fonts</li>
<li>scripts</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Do I Use It</h3>
<p>This module has no front end interface, only an admin interface. It allows selecting any of the above-mentioned components, enter package info, and click "Export".  An XML file containing all the components of the package will be created for download. That file can be distributed to import the package into other CMSMS installations.</p>
<h3>Permissions</h3>
<p>A strict permissions model is enforced for the Themes Manager, to ensure database integrity.  The permission "Manage Themes" is required to export themes and import themes.</p>
<p>As well, the opposite functionality exists, you may upload a package file (xml format) and have the enclosed templates, stylesheets, pages, module templates, global content blocks, user defined tags, module settings and files automatically imported into your CMSMS installation.</p>
